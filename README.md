# Music Store Data Analysis - SQL Queries

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries developed to analyze a music store database. The queries address common business questions, such as identifying top artists by albums, employee reporting hierarchy, revenue generation by album and genre, customer demographics, and track performance.

The dataset structure is similar to the Chinook database, a sample database that resembles an actual digital media store.

## Queries Included
- Top artists by number of albums created
- Employee reporting structure (manager to employee relationships)
- Total revenue generated by each album and genre
- Customer base analysis by country and year
- Identification of unsold tracks by album
- Customer spending by artist
- List of tracks longer than average duration

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to demonstrate SQL skills related to data extraction, joining tables, aggregation, filtering, and basic business analytics. It suits aspiring data analysts and anyone learning complex database querying.

  
## Tool
- SQL: Queries written in standard SQL compatible with relational databases like MySQL
